=============== About ===============

This is a five-pages website about a business preparing meal subscription business:
    index.html: This is the main page of the website.
    page2.html: This page shows customer some benefits of the meal subscription service.
    page3.html: This page shows some meal examples provided (a photo gallery)
    page4.html: This is a faq page
    page5.html: This is a page containing a form to contact the business.

The page design is a minimalistic style, where there will be lots of spaces around the pages to show simplicity of the design. 
The seperate css files for each pages would enables easy deletion of a webpage, so if we ever need to delete a webpage, we can just delete that css instead of going through an enormous css file to find the involved css rules
